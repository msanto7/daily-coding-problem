# Daily Coding Problem: Problem #120 [Medium]

## Problem

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Implement the singleton pattern with a twist. First, instead of storing one instance, store two instances. And in every even call of getInstance(), return the first instance and in every odd call of getInstance(), return the second instance.

## Solution 

--> So the goal of the singleton pattern is to ensure that only one instance of a class can be created at a time. 
--> In javascript specifically an object literal could be an example of a singleton. 
--> $ in jquery could also be a singleton


--> Lazy Instantiation vs Eager Initialization
