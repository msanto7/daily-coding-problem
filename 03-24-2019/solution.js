// Daily Coding Problem: Problem #121 [Hard]

// Given a string which we can delete at most k, return whether you can make a palindrome.

// For example, given 'waterrfetawx' and a k of 2, you could delete f and x to get 'waterretaw'.

// so how would we simply identitfy if the original string is a palendrome ?
// first of all we may be able to seperate between odd num letters and even num letters
