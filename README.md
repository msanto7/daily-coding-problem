# daily-coding-problem

## Explained 

This repo will store the daily questions from dailycodingproblem.com

Each folder will contain the question for that day. In addition I will provide my answer or answers in what will most likely end up being a javascript file.

I will also link various resources that I used or may be useful to solve or understand the problem at hand.



## The Goal 

Will be making this a daily task...so I am consistently thinking in terms of code and solving problems. 

I want to be commiting to my personal github everyday. I should be doing something involving programming on my own outside of work everyday.
